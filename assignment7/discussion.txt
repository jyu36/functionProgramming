DISCUSSION EXERCISE

One problem with monad encodings is the run-time complexity might be greater.

For a string s of length n, calculate the asymptotic complexity of
  (a) are_balanced_mutable s
  (b) are_balanced_monadic s
respectively. Show your work so you can get partial credit.

Write your answer below.


(a) 

O(n)
- String.fold iterates through each character once: O(n) iterations
- For each character, the parse function either:
    Pushes () onto the stack: O(1) using Core.Stack.push
    Pops from the stack and compares: O(1) using Core.Stack.pop_exn
    Does nothing (for other characters): O(1)
- After the fold, Stack.is_empty checks if stack is empty: O(1)
- Total: O(n) * O(1) + O(1) = O(n)

(b) 

O(n)
- String.to_list converts string to list: O(n)
- list_fold_m processes each character sequentially: O(n) iterations
- For each character, parse creates a monadic computation that:
    For '(': push to stack is O(1) - cons operation (a :: stack)
    For ')': pop from stack is O(1) - pattern match and return head
    For others: return is O(1)
- Each bind/return operation constructs a function composition: O(1)
- When run executes the final composed function, it applies all n operations
  sequentially, each taking O(1) time
- Final is_empty check: O(1)
- Total: O(n) + O(n) * O(1) + O(1) = O(n)
